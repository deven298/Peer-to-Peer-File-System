Few starting steps:

Enter the port number (just a number, for example: 8080) of server in server.c file located in server folder.

Similarly, enter the server IP address in SERVER_IP variable, enter your IP address in MY_IP variable and then server listening port number (number that you used in previous step) in SERVER_LISTENING_PORT variable in client.c file located in client folder.

Compile code by changing current working directory to the server or client directory.
